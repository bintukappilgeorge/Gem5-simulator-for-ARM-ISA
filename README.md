## MOESI Cache Coherence Protocol Modification in gem5

### Project Overview
This project involves modifying the MOESI CMP Directory cache coherence protocol within the gem5 simulator. The objective is to understand the protocol's state transitions, implement assigned modifications in the MOESI_CMP_directory-L1cache.sm file, and validate the changes through benchmark tests.

### Key Objectives
- Study and modify the MOESI CMP Directory protocol in gem5.
- Create a complete state transition diagram of the L1 cache controller.
- Implement assigned protocol modifications based on the given project version.
- Build and test gem5 with the modified protocol.
- Run benchmarks to evaluate the changes.
- Generate a patch file to apply modifications to a clean gem5 build.
